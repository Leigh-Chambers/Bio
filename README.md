# A little bit about me and my projects

Hello everyone! 

My name is Leigh and I am a Computer Science Masters Student. The projects you see here are a mixture of projects completed as part of my study program and projects created as part of the courses and development I have pursued on my own. (Udemy, coursera, EDX projects etc) 

I've been studying computer science since 2020 and I am really enjoying throwing myself into it full time. I am hoping to change careers into a CS field and continue growing and devloping my skills.
